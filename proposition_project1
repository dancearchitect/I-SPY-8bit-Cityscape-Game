	"A retro take on a classic brain game, find all the items specified in the alotted time and enjoy a beautiful 8bit scene upon completion."

	-WIN: Once all items are cleared the cloudy city opens up to clears skys and a creamsicle sunset, possibly with 8bit music, and animations of twinkling city lights.

	-LOSE: If time runs out an animation of the city spiraling into a dark abyss that reads "GAME OVER" will play, then display "Try Again?" to replay game.

	I will being using event listeners to make items clickable and initiate the WIN or LOSE functions once cleared or time runs out.
	I'm hoping to incorporate 8bit music for the gameplay, WIN and LOSE outcomes.
	The 8bit WIN animation and LOSE animation will be executed by CSS animation and for loops along with if/if else/else statements.

	Building the cityscapes will require using a .jpg image as the cityscape and .jpg icons ontop of the image that will respond to mouse clicks through floating invisible divs.
	I expect to face challenges with implementing the floats and event listeners.
	My plan to execute this will be through Google sources, applying the Duck Hunt hw and working with dev friends.
