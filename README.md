_Disclaimer: This game is not mobile friendly... YET! I will deploy a mobile friendly version soon!_<br />
_Cityscape image in README will not display items. No cheating ;)_<br >

A retro take on a classic brain game, find all the items specified in the<br />
alotted time and watch the cityscape change upon completion.

### RULES:
Players will have **1 minute** to find **9 items** in New York City.<br />
There will be a hint as to which item to find above the image that will read, **"I spy..."**<br />
Click the correct icon and it will **disappear** from the page!<br />
Complete the cityscape by clearing each item to win the game!
